 🧠 Detailed Project Explanation

 🔹 1. Motivation — Why Deepfake Detection?
With the advancement of AI-driven media generation tools like DeepFaceLab and FaceSwap, **deepfake videos** have become alarmingly realistic and easily accessible.  
While this technology can be used creatively in film and entertainment, it also poses **serious ethical and security concerns**, including misinformation, identity theft, and political manipulation.

As a Computer Science and Engineering student passionate about Artificial Intelligence, I wanted to develop a project that:
- Combines **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**  
- Has **real-world social impact**  
- Demonstrates a complete **AI/ML pipeline** from data preprocessing to model interpretability  

Thus, the idea of **Deepfake Video Detection using AI** was chosen — to classify whether a given video is *real* or *fake* by analyzing facial patterns, micro-expressions, and texture inconsistencies.

 🔹 2. Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Develop a model that can accurately distinguish between *real* and *AI-generated (fake)* faces in videos.  
- Implement a **frame-level and video-level classification system** using deep learning.  
- Ensure **model interpretability** through Grad-CAM visualizations.  

This provides not just performance but also **transparency** — understanding *why* the model makes certain predictions.

 🔹 3. Dataset and Preprocessing
The dataset used comes from **Mendeley**, consisting of:
- **53 real videos**
- **53 fake videos**

Each video is processed using **OpenCV Haar Cascades** to detect and crop faces frame by frame.  
A fixed number of frames (8 per video) are extracted for consistency.  
These cropped faces form the image dataset used for training and evaluation.

All images are resized to **224×224 pixels**, normalized, and augmented with random flips and color jitter to enhance generalization.

 🔹 4. Architecture Used — ResNet-18 (Transfer Learning)
The backbone of this project is **ResNet-18**, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network from the **ResNet (Residual Network)** family.

 🧩 Key Concept: Residual Learning
Deep networks often suffer from **vanishing gradients** — where deeper layers fail to learn due to gradient decay.  
ResNet solves this by introducing **shortcut (skip) connections**, allowing gradients to flow directly to earlier layers.  

Mathematically, instead of learning the mapping `H(x)`, the network learns:
F(x) = H(x) - x => H(x) = F(x) + x

This simple residual addition stabilizes training even in deep architectures.

 🧱 ResNet-18 Architecture Flow
ResNet-18 consists of 18 layers (convolutional + fully connected) arranged as:

Input Image (224x224)
↓
Conv + BatchNorm + ReLU
↓
Residual Block 1 (64 filters)
Residual Block 2 (128 filters)
Residual Block 3 (256 filters)
Residual Block 4 (512 filters)
↓
Global Average Pooling
↓
Fully Connected Layer → 2 outputs (Real, Fake)

In this project:
- We use **transfer learning** — loading ResNet-18 pre-trained on **ImageNet**.
- The **final fully connected (FC)** layer is replaced with a custom classifier of 2 output neurons (for real/fake).
- Earlier layers are **fine-tuned** with a low learning rate (0.0001) to adapt ImageNet features to face textures.

🔹 5. Training Pipeline
1. **Input:** Cropped and preprocessed face images  
2. **Augmentation:** RandomResizedCrop, Horizontal Flip, ColorJitter  
3. **Model:** ResNet-18 (with pretrained weights)  
4. **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss (for binary classification)  
5. **Optimizer:** Adam (learning rate = 1e-4)  
6. **Batch Size:** 16  
7. **Epochs:** 10  

Training is done using **Google Colab GPU** for efficiency.

---

🔹 6. Evaluation Metrics
After training, the model is evaluated on unseen test data using:
- **Accuracy**  
- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
- **ROC-AUC Score**  

This ensures a well-rounded understanding of how the model performs across both classes (real/fake).

Example results:
Test Accuracy: ~88%
Precision (Fake): 0.90
Recall (Fake): 0.86
F1-Score: 0.88

 🔹 7. Grad-CAM — Model Explainability
While accuracy is important, understanding **why** the model predicts something is even more valuable.  
For this, **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** is used.

Grad-CAM generates **heatmaps** showing the regions of the face that influenced the model’s decision.  
- If a video is fake, Grad-CAM often highlights *unnatural blending areas* around the eyes, lips, or skin edges.  
- For real videos, focus is typically on natural facial structure and shading.

This step enhances **trust and transparency**, especially important for deepfake detection applications.

 🔹 8. Improvements and Betterment
While this model performs strongly on small datasets, potential enhancements include:
- Using **EfficientNet or Vision Transformers (ViT)** for better accuracy on large datasets.  
- Incorporating temporal analysis (LSTM/3D CNN) to capture motion-based inconsistencies across video frames.  
- Training on larger, more diverse datasets like **DFDC (Deepfake Detection Challenge)**.  
- Developing a **real-time detection web app** using Flask or Streamlit for deployment.  

Each of these can improve robustness and scalability for real-world use.

🔹 9. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the end-to-end process of **Deepfake Detection** using modern AI techniques.
